Mirra is made of a minimal number of parts and is easily disassembled for recycling; the recycled content is high, and it's 96 percent recyclable. Recylable fabric. Latitude back upholstery is 100 percent recyclable. \n\nDesign Story\nTo create the Mirra chair, Herman Miller teamed with Studio 7.5, a German design firm. Composed of five designers--Claudia Plikat, Burkhard Schmitz, Nicolai Neubert, Carola Zwick, and Roland Zwick--Studio 7.5 has been involved for over 10 years in the design and development of products that improve the way people work. They consider themselves 'the grandchildren of the Eameses' and, like those pioneering designers, they are experts at observing how workers interact with their environments and finding ways to make that interaction more natural. Sharing a genuine passion for seating, they know seating as a science and work to bring it to another level. Rather than relying on any individual in the firm, Studio 7.5 works as a team, without titles or hierarchy. The Mirra chair is a product of their collective imagination, talent, and persistence--along with a willingness to break the mold in order to create a chair that sets a new standard for comfort, fit, balanced ride, and visual refinement in its price range. Studio 7.5 envisioned a chair that reacts to what people do. Part of the concept was to make the chair like a second skin, like a shadow of the sitter. From this concept, Mirra's passive adjustability was born. From the TriFlex back to the AireWeave seat suspension to the Harmonic tilt, Mirra does just what Studio 7.5 worked to achieve: Just sit on it, and it fits. There are only a few adjustment controls, and they are designed to be very intuitive. Mirra features common materials applied in original ways--such as the elastomeric seat suspension and molded polymer back that are used instead of foam and fabric.""]",Herman Miller,"September 27, 2007",

There are no locks and no tension springs to negotiate. Instead, there are elegant mechanisms that automatically support your body in every position you'll assume throughout the day. Headrests are added to chairs because your head needs support when you recline, which is why people without headrests put their hands behind their heads when they lean back.

Dr. Sang-Ho Lee of Wooridul knows modern living habits in this day and age leads to back problem with how much time we spend in front of our computers, so he got the idea to design a chair that would reduce spinal stress and promote correct posture. He had seen surgical chairs designed for leaning forward without any back support to enhance concentration while leaning forward and realized these types of chairs have real world applications. Everything on the Aero7 is designed with proper posture in mind from the bottom to the top. The base of the chair is an ABS plastic, BIFMA certified, 6 point base, this 6th point of contact with the floor provides extra stability other chairs lack. At the same time this six point base features wheel covers that are nearly flat yet contoured to match the arch of the bottom of the foot. Naturally when you sit in the chair you want to place your feet on the wheel covers, by doing this youre elevating your thighs and adjusting your hip alignment which helps you maintain correct posture, The height adjustable seat is comfortable and subtly angled so that it arches your hip forward slightly helping align your spine more upright improving your posture. The padded upper body support is the real intriguing part of the chair, as this both functions as an arm rest and a backrest depending on how you have it oriented. Its glides freely from back rest to chest rest pivoting around the left side of your body, and the angle of the padded support can be adjusted for fine-tuning your sitting preferences. To adjust the upper support pad all you need to do is grab the metal support bar on your left (when positioned as a chest pad) with your left hand, and then grab the far right end of the upper pad with your right hand and push the pad horizontally towards your left. The pad will slide over a quarter inch and then using your right hand you can you can change the upper pads orientation to however you would prefer.']",Wooridul,"August 7, 2013",$74.99

Even when leaning forward, the seat edge flexes to relieve pressure on the back of the legs. In short, the Leap chair\'s ergonomic advances allow you to work comfortably, and more productively, in a proven healthy manner for extended periods of time. Features:  Live Back technology: This built-in ergonomic design allows the back of the seat to change shape to support your entire spine.  Natural Glide System: The seat glides forward so you can recline without leaving your Vision and Reach Zone, and stay oriented to your work. This encourages more varied postures so there\'s less static load on the spine.  Thermal Comfort: Because of slats in both its back and seat, and the special foam it uses, the Leap chair offers excellent breathability.  Lower Back Firmness control: This control enables you to set a constant amount of firmness to help maintain your lower spine\'s natural curve.  Upper Back Force control: Upper back force control enables you to set the amount of \\""push back\\"" that you desire as you recline.  Adjustable Seat Depth: Adjustable seat depth accommodates different body shapes for long-term comfort.

Leaning posture encourages a hip-to-torso range of 130 to 135 degrees, which provides less pressure on your spine and connecting muscles when compared to standing. Pivoting seat leg encourages dynamic movement, and the seat pan tilts up to 5 degrees to help support hip flexibility. Seat features a non-slip, easy-to-clean seat cushion that may help to reduce pressure points. Seat is made to work with standing desks and tables, and is rated up to 300 lbs. Easy-adjust piston-release handle raises and lowers the seat, accommodates user heights between 4\' 11"" to 6\' 10"". Seat is discreetly designed with wheels for easy portability and the post folds for easy storage. Anti-Fatigue Mat (included) may help to relieve stress on your feet and lower body while leaning/perching, providing a more comfortable working experience.
