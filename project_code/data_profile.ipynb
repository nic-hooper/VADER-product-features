       " 'while this chair is very nice unfortunately it was not as well padded as i had expected  i had sat in the exact same model at a business office that i was in last year  it was the most comfortable chair i had ever sat in i actually turned the chair over to get the manufacturer and item number  i knew i just had to have it  so when i purchased this one a few months ago i couldnt wait to get it  as i said it is just ok  not worth the price i paid for it  it is definitely not as soft and comfortable as the one i sat in last year dont know what the difference is unless this company made a cheap imitation  im very disappointed',\n",

       " 'chairs are very individual  this one is not comfortable for me  i feel like im leaning forward all the time and would rather sink into than slide forward on a chair  i like car bucket seats and this one in spite of the memory foam just doesnt hold me in  i had a chair that was comfortable and cost  vs this one but the arms wore out within year  i keyed off of that when purchasing this hon and the arms are really great  good material a little rubbery give but no leather to wear off like my old one did if i could put these arms on my old chair id be set  im probably going to buy another chair but will do it locally so i can sit inon it first  like test driving an automobile you cant do it by reading reviews',\n",

       " 'this review is for the executive highback cloth version of the chair  the chair came shipped in a big box and when you open it up its in two piecesthe part you sit on with the armrests already attached and the bottom part with the rollers  remove the blue plastic piece from the top of the bottom piece which has the cylinder which goes into the hole of the bottom of the seat part attach the two pieces together and youre pretty much done  there was no instructions included but its easy to figure out how to assemble  the cloth and stitching seems pretty sturdy  the armrests also seem like theyre attached pretty good  the cushioning is oknothing special and some people might want to add a pillow  the cushion part you sit on is a bit short so you cant really sit cross legged in the chair if you want  you cant lock the chair with it tilted back  in fact you can only lock the chair when its fully forward and in that position it feels like youre pushed forward a bit as the front of the chair may be tilted towards the floor slightly and it feels like you will slide off the chair unless you brace your feet when sitting down  the back is not high enough for me to rest the back of my head on unless the chair is unlocked and the chair is tilted all the way back im ft in  this isnt really a chair you can relax in but if youre the type to sit straight up while working at your computer this chair is a pretty good buy as itll probably last longer than one of those fake leather chairs that starts peeling and falling apart in a year  this chair is probably one of the more sturdy ones ive been able to find thats made of cloth',\n",
